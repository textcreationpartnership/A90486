            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON Friday last about five of the clock in the morning, our Generals resolved to fight the enemy; and after seeking the Lord for a blessing in this great work, we engaged their whole Fleet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of about 80 sail, who were convoying neer upon 300 Merchants homewards; we were not above 60 sail, yet disputed it till 7 of the clock in the Evening, great execution being done on both sides, as appears by the inclosed Narrative and List. The fable night ending the dispute, both fleets lay neer each other with their Lights forth; and on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday morning the fight began again, which was with great gallantry maintained by Gen. Blake, with his own Squadron, viz.</p>

            <p>All which, bare up to the enemy with so gallant a spirit of resolution, that (by the assistance of General Monk with the Vanguard and others) before 3 of the clock on Friday, we had taken, sunk, and fired 15 sail, whereof one is their Vice-Admiral, a stout ship of 60 Guns; another, their Rear-admiral, a gallant ship, and fought bravely; indeed, so they did all; but General Blake having got the wind-ward of them, charged with such an irresistable and magnanimous spirit, that Vantrump endeavoured to decline en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, which his Excellency perceiving, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly pursu'd; so that a third and fourth conflict hapned; during which disputes, the famous Triumph (to the perpetual eternizing of the Generals fame be it spoken) received neer upon seven hundred shots, wherein was slain that noble and approved souldier capt. Ball, with some others; besides many wounded; amongst the rest, the General himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wound upon the Thigh by an unhappy splinter (but its hoped not dangerous) which splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter took away part of General Deanes breeches, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118243:3"/> not any part of his body at the least hurt. In this fight Captain Mildmay, and Captain Barker, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thsmselves with singular dexterity and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; but at last received their mortal wounds; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our Secretary, whose deaths are much lamented. Both our Rear-Admirals have lost their Main-masts, but are got safe into portsmouth; we have also lost the Sampson, which was so extreamly rent and torn, that she was even almost full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; until which time, the Souldiers and Mariners resolved not to desert her; but at last was forced to eseape in boats.</p>
            <p>The enemies loss is far greater; for we have sunk fired, and taken about 19, and are now in pursuit of them towards their own Coast.</p>
            <p>Their Merchant-men are conceived lay up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Coast of France all the time of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; and we doubt not but to give a good account of this memorable Expedition very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly. Vice-admiral Pen endeavored to come seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably in to our assistance, with 14 sail, from the Downs; but was prevented by cross windes; yet it pleased God he came timely to the pursuit. We are now in a gallant condition; since the Lord was pleased to crown the endeavors of our Fleet with happy success; for which we desire to magnifie his great and glorious Name.</p>

But now that the Zealand Lords are arrived here, somewhat more will be attempted, not onely for him, but also in the behalf of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range Family.
